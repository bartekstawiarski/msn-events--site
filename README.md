# Nuxt Minimal Starter

In my way.
Look at the [Nuxt documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/introduction) to learn more.

Check out the [deployment documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/deployment) for more information.

## Development Server

Start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`:

```bash

# bun
bun i
bun dev
```
